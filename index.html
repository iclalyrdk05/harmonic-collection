<h3>Turkish Tea: A Symbol of Conversation </h3>

<h4> </h4>

<h5></h5>

<h6></h6>

<p>In Turkish culture, tea (çay) is more than just a drink; it symbolizes connection and hospitality. Whether welcoming guests, after a meal, watching TV in the evening, or playing games with friends, tea is ever-present in Turkish social gatherings. It plays a key role in breakfast, often serving as a unifying element for families.

  After meals, a large pot of tea is brewed, and for hours, it is slowly sipped, cup by cup, by everyone in the household. If guests are present, the hosts rarely sit down, continuously refilling cups to keep the flow of tea and conversation going. The steady rhythm of pouring and drinking tea reflects the warmth and depth of the conversation.
  
  In winter, tea warms the soul, and in summer, it refreshes. It's a timeless drink, essential in every season and every gathering. </p>
