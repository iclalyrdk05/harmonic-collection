        <h3>True Tea</h3>
        <p>"Traditional tea ceremonies often honor the Camellia sinensis plant, known as true tea, with varieties like white, green, oolong, and black. Due to tea's widespread popularity, it has inspired herbal, or wild, tea ceremonies, creating new rituals that merge ancient traditions with modern-day lifestyles."</p>

        <h3>Finding Inspiration in Herbal Teas</h3>
        <p>"Unlike traditional tea ceremonies, herbal tea ceremonies allow for creativity based on local plants and personal preferences. By choosing plants like dandelion, mint, or chamomile, you can create unique rituals with roots in your surroundings and lifestyle."</p>

        <h4>Crafting a Ceremony</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Purpose: Set an intention for your ceremony.</li>
            <li>Setting: Whether indoors or outdoors, make your space beautiful and inviting.</li>
            <li>Sequence: Begin with silence, serve tea with mindful actions, and close with gratitude.</li>
        </ul>

            <p>"I drink the tea, the essence of the leaves becoming a part of me. This is the act of life, in one pure moment." — Thich Nhat Hanh</p>
