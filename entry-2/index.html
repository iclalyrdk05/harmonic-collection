    <h2>Espresso: The Duality of Speed and Savoring</h2>
    <p>Espresso holds an important place in coffee culture and is widely appreciated by coffee lovers around the world. Originating from Italy, this brewing method uses high-pressure and hot water to extract the natural oils and aromas of coffee, resulting in a more intense flavor. Espresso offers speed and efficiency, introducing variety and creativity to the coffee world, and forming the foundation of popular beverages like Americano, latte, and cappuccino. In this way, it contributes to the enrichment of coffee culture.</p>

    <p>Espresso is a symbol of quality and craftsmanship in the coffee industry. Brewing the perfect espresso requires careful processes, such as selecting the right coffee beans and applying the correct techniques. Additionally, it promotes coffee education and knowledge sharing, encouraging sustainability awareness. Therefore, espresso makes significant contributions to the development of coffee culture, both through technical innovations and its social and cultural impact.</p>

    <p><strong>Who drinks this coffee? Where is it usually consumed?</strong></p>

    <p>We often witness people drinking espresso either when they're in a rush or when they're calm. Those in a rush drink it like a quick dose of caffeine to wake up, while the ones sipping slowly seem to want to savor its full flavor. Espresso is meant to be sipped slowly, with each sip enjoyed to the fullest. In other words, this coffee is consumed either on fast-paced or slow, relaxed mornings.</p>
