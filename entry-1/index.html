            <div class="text-box">
                <p>In Turkish culture, tea (çay) is more than just a drink; it symbolizes connection and hospitality. Whether welcoming guests, after a meal, watching TV in the evening, or playing games with friends, tea is ever-present in Turkish social gatherings. It plays a key role in breakfast, often serving as a unifying element for families.</p>

            <div class="text-box">
                <p>After meals, a large pot of tea is brewed, and for hours, it is slowly sipped, cup by cup, by everyone in the household. If guests are present, the hosts rarely sit down, continuously refilling cups to keep the flow of tea and conversation going. The steady rhythm of pouring and drinking tea reflects the warmth and depth of the conversation.</p>

            <div class="text-box">
                <p>Traditional tea houses, known as <em>çay bahçesi</em>, serve as hubs of social activity in Turkey. Here, locals gather to play backgammon, discuss politics, or simply enjoy the soothing ambiance. The clinking of glasses, the hum of conversation, and the occasional call for another round of tea create a lively, welcoming atmosphere that captures the essence of Turkish community spirit.</p>
